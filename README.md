# Kubernetes Escape Room Game

You are a wizard apprentice. While your teacher is out of house you decided to sneak into his study to practice some spells. 
Maybe try out some magic artifacts you find there. 
But while reciting an incantation you found in a hidden tome something went horribly wrong. 
Important things are missing or not working anymore. It is now on you to fix what has been broken.
